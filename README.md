# AirBnB Clone

This project aims to replicate a simplified version of the AirBnB platform to develop web application skills over the course of a year. The goal is to create a functional web app with key features such as a command-line interface (CLI), a website with static and dynamic content, a data storage system, and an API for communication between the front-end and back-end.

## Project Components

By the end of the project, the following components will be developed:

### 1. Command Interpreter
- A CLI to interact with the data for development and debugging.

### 2. Website
- A static and dynamic interface that simulates the AirBnB platform.

### 3. Data Storage
- A system (database or files) to store and manage data such as users, places, and bookings.

### 4. API
- A set of endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For back-end development and CLI.
- **Web Framework**: Flask/Django (choose based on preference).
- **Database Management**: SQLAlchemy or similar ORM.
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with web application development.
- Learn how to implement CRUD operations through an API.
- Develop a full-stack web application.
